## Github link:
https://github.com/shankar9522/ENPM661-Proj-3

### Libraries:
Numpy, matplotlib, rospy, pandas, csv, time, geometry_msgs

### Instructions to run the A* python code to generate the path:
1. Run the python code: 'Obstacle 2 (gazebo).py' using the IDE that supports user input or using a terminal with python 3 (preferably python 3.8.10).
2. Enter the input - starting and goal coordinates and orientation of the robot. The program will prompt the user to enter valid values until valid values are entered.
3. The code will generate the explored nodes, best path and a csv file that contains list of wheel RPMs.
4. Observe the output and exit out of the code by closing the matplotlib window.

### Instructions to run the ROS package to execute the generated path:
1. Add the project3_phase2 folder in your catkin workspace (~/catkin_ws/src)
2. Add the generated rpm.csv to the data folder of the ros package (be sure to remove the earlier one if you are creating and adding a new csv from the generator code)
3. cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
4. roslaunch project3_phase2 proj3_phase2_launch.launch
5. Gazebo window will open and the spawned turtlebot will approximately follow the path generated by the path generation code

_Please note that the python code for the publisher is located in the scripts folder in the package_

### Input parameters:
enter starting x coordinate: 50
enter starting y coordinate: 100
enter starting orientation: 0
enter final x coordinate: 550
enter final y coordinate: 100
enter high RPM (recommended 6 and 3): 6
enter low RPM (recommended 6 and 3): 3
enter clearance: 15

Turtlebot path execution video:     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABoryeCWl0

_Please note that for the exploration video the case is different than the turtlebot video as it is taking some time to generate new video_
